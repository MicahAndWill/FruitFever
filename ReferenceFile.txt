	SCENERY:


		// Micah document Flower file structure (with the exception cases)  


	ENEMIES:

		The accepted format for declaring an enemy is to replace
		a '-' character with <Enemy-Type Race-Color left right up down> in the
		for format of <a-z a-z int , int , int , int>. 

		NOTE: If all left, right, up & down are all zero then the enemy assumes 
		default behavior. 

		Examples:

		------
		--<ab4,12,0,0>---
		------

		^^^creates an enemy of type 'a' (triangle) of Color/Race 'b' (yellow) that
		can move 4 units left of its original position and 12 units right (total of 17 units). 


		-----
		<ba0,0,5, 6>--<ba0,0,5,2>--
		-----

		^^^ Creates Two enemies of type 'b' (flying circle) and Race/Color 'a' (blue).
		One moves between its original position and 5 units down and the other moves up 5
		and down 2 (covers a total of 8 units)
