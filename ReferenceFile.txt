		BlueBlock   --> f
		YellowBlock --> g
		RedBlock    --> h
		GreenBlock  --> i
		PurpleBlock --> j
		GrayBlock   --> k
		WhiteBlock0 --> l
		WhiteBlock1 --> m
		WhiteBlock2 --> n
		BlackBlock  --> o

		GrassBrownblock0 --> A
		GrassBrownblock1 --> B

	SCENERY (Will, I gave these (poor) names, can you give them better names, since you know exactly what they are?):

		-TOP ROW:
		Wide Plant (V-Shaped) --> a
		Weeds --> b
		Yellow Flower --> c
		Pink Flower --> d
		Plant --> e
		Tree (No Blossoms) --> f
		Tree (Blossoms) --> g
		
		-BOTTOM ROW:
		Tree Trunk --> h
		Grass --> i
		Plant2 --> j
		Marijuana Plant --> k
		Plant3 --> l
		Mushroom (Small) --> m
		Mushroom (Medium) --> n
		Mushroom (Large) --> o
		
	ENEMIES:

		The accepted format for declaring an enemy is to replace
		a '-' character with <Enemy-Type Race-Color left right up down> in the
		for format of <a-z a-z int , int , int , int>. 

		NOTE: If all left, right, up & down are all zero then the enemy assumes 
		default behavior. 

		Examples:

		------
		--<ab4,12,0,0>---
		------

		^^^creates an enemy of type 'a' (triangle) of Color/Race 'b' (yellow) that
		can move 4 units left of its original position and 12 units right (total of 17 units). 


		-----
		<ba0,0,5, 6>--<ba0,0,5,2>--
		-----

		^^^ Creates Two enemies of type 'b' (flying circle) and Race/Color 'a' (blue).
		One moves between its original position and 5 units down and the other moves up 5
		and down 2 (covers a total of 8 units)
